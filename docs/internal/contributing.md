| File/Directory name | Description |
| - | - |
| `package.json` | npm package description. (see: [Configuring package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json)) |
| `tsconfig.json` | 'Solution'-like TypeScript project file with references to all sub-projects. (see: [What is a tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html); [TSConfig Reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/); [Project References](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html)) |
| `src` | Each sub-directory contains source code for a library or client application. |
| `test` | Each sub-directory contains automated tests corresponding to a directory of the same name under `src`. |
| `scripts` | Node.js command-line programs, shell scripts, and other utilities intended to be used in the development environment. |
| `config` | Configuration files. |
| `config/ts` | TypeScript base configurations and sub-projects. |
| `src/unnamed_project` | Core app logic that doesn't depend on client-specific APIs (such as web browser APIs or Node.js). |
| `src/unnamed_project_web` | Client views and logic that depends on web browser APIs and libraries. |
| `scripts/common` | Utility library for scripts. |
| `scripts/project` | Programs for managing the project, such as build scripts. |
| `scripts/cli` | Command-line programs that can use the core app (`src/unnamed_project`). |
| `config/project` | Configuration files for programs in `scripts/project`. |
| `priv` | Application-specific static files. |
| `priv/assets` | Static files (such as fonts and images) deployed to `_dist` for `unnamed_project_web`. |
| `docs` | Dedicated documentation files. |
| `docs/internal` | Documentation for internal developers. |
| `docs/examples` | Examples with commentary for internal developers. |
| `docs/src` | Documentation files that must be compiled or collected by another program to produce some final artifacts. |
| `_build` | Generated folder containing build artifacts. |
| `_build/dev` | Generated files that aid development tools, such as files generated by `tsc` to assist LSP servers for IDEs. |
| `_build/intermediary` | Where scripts can store generated files that are inconvenient to regenerate often. Each script should store their files in a uniquely-named sub-directory, e.g., `_build/intermediary/my_namespace`. |
| `_dist` | Generated folder containing all files that will be deployed to production for `unnamed_project_web`. |
